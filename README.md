# Translation cost analysis

This app calculates the translation costs based on an analysis from MemoQ. You can select different discount models to see what the effect is on the total price. All changes are saved to local storage (on your computer) so you can exit your browser and come back later to review or update the analysis. No data is saved on any server. It's a great app to get an idea of the amount of work involved in a translation (hours) and the costs you should be charging your client.

On first run you'll see an analysis with a lot of repetitions and some matches. This was based on one of the comics by Mox.
